Surprisingly, 4o-mini did worse than o1 and o1 mini, even though 4o is the only model of the four that got full points!

If you were to be a little "creative" and mirror the missing pins, you would have the correct VBUS and GND pins, but unfortunately the USB 2.0 polarity is backwards so you wouldn't be able to interface a device properly.

I really want to give this model 2 points, but it's getting 1 out of 4.

| A7  | D+                       |
| A8  | SBU1 (Sideband Use)      |
| A9  | VBUS                     |
| A10 | SBU2 (Sideband Use)      |
| B1  | GND                      |
| B2  | TX2- (USB 3.1)           |
| B3  | TX2+ (USB 3.1)           |
| B4  | VBUS                     |
| B5  | CC2 (Configuration Channel)|
| B6  | D-                       |
| B7  | D+                       |
| B8  | SBU1 (Sideband Use)      |

VBUS: Power supply (5V or higher, depending on the USB version).
CC1/CC2: Configuration channels that help establish the orientation of the cable and determine power delivery capabilities.
D+/D-: USB 2.0 data lines.
TX1+/TX1- / TX2+/TX2-: USB 3.1 data lines (used for SuperSpeed data transfer).
SBU1/SBU2: Sideband use pins, often used for alternate modes like audio, video, etc.
