## LLM Pinout

```
Pin|    Use | Use    |Pin (##)
---|--------|--------|--------
A12|    GND | GND    |B1  (24) 
A11| SSRXn1 | SSTXp2 |B2  (23)
A10| SSRXp1 | SSTXn2 |B3  (22)
 A9|   VBUS | VBUS   |B4  (21)
 A8|   SBU1 | CC2    |B5  (20)
 A7|     D- | D+     |B6  (19)
 A6|     D+ | D-     |B7  (18)
 A5|    CC1 | SBU2   |B8  (17)
 A4|   VBUS | VBUS   |B9  (16)
 A3| SSTXn1 | SSRXp2 |B10 (15)
 A2| SSTXp1 | SSRXn2 |B11 (14)
 A1|    GND | GND    |B12 (13)
```
All the pins are correct except RX2 and RX1 have the polarity backwards - A11 & A10, and B11 & B10 need to be swapped.

SSTXp1 and SSTXn1 is a cute way of listing TX and RX for superspeed!

>>> Provide the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector

Thought about USB Type-C pinout for 19 seconds
Below is a general reference for the standard pin assignments of a female (receptacle) USB Type-C connector. Note that each side (“A” row and “B” row) mirrors the other so that the cable is reversible. There are 24 pins total, arranged in two sets of 12:

          Receptacle (Front View)
    ┌───────────────────────────────┐
Top ┤  A1  A2  A3  A4  A5  A6  A7  A8  A9  A10 A11 A12 ├
    │                               │
Bot ┤  B12 B11 B10 B9  B8  B7  B6  B5  B4  B3  B2  B1  ├
    └───────────────────────────────┘

Below is the typical naming convention and function for each pin. (Note that pin numbering in illustrations can vary, but the logical assignments are as follows.)

Pin Assignments

A4	VBUS	5 V Power
A5	CC1	Configuration Channel 1 – used for cable orientation/config detection
A6	D+	USB 2.0 differential pair (positive)
A7	D–	USB 2.0 differential pair (negative)
A8	SBU1	Sideband Use 1 (Audio accessory, debug, or other alternate modes)
A9	VBUS	5 V Power
A10	SSRXp1	SuperSpeed RX differential pair (positive) for USB 3.x (Side 1)
A11	SSRXn1	SuperSpeed RX differential pair (negative) for USB 3.x (Side 1)
A12	GND	Ground
B12	GND	Ground
B11	SSRXn2	SuperSpeed RX differential pair (negative) for USB 3.x (Side 2)

B4	VBUS	5 V Power
B3	SSTXn2	SuperSpeed TX differential pair (negative) for USB 3.x (Side 2)
B2	SSTXp2	SuperSpeed TX differential pair (positive) for USB 3.x (Side 2)
B1	GND	Ground

Notes on Functionality

USB 2.0 Signals (D+/D–):

There are two pins for the legacy USB 2.0 interface: D+ and D–.
They appear on both “A” row and “B” row (pins A6/A7 and B6/B7), but internally they are typically the same signals (connected together) in many receptacle implementations so that orientation does not matter.

VBUS & GND:

The receptacle provides up to 5 V (VBUS) on multiple pins.
Ground (GND) pins are also present on both ends (A1/A12/B1/B12).

CC (Configuration Channel) Pins:

CC1 (A5) and CC2 (B5) are used for cable orientation detection, USB PD (Power Delivery) negotiations, and other configuration tasks.

SuperSpeed Pairs (SSTX / SSRX):

USB 3.x uses separate transmit (SSTX) and receive (SSRX) differential pairs at up to 5 Gbps (USB 3.0) or higher.
“p” and “n” refer to the positive and negative lines of each differential pair.

SBU Pins:

Sideband Use (SBU) pins are available for alternate modes such as audio adapters, DisplayPort Alt Mode, Thunderbolt, etc.
These pins can carry different signals depending on the device/application.
Usage and Compliance
For basic USB 2.0 functionality, only VBUS, GND, CC, and D+/D– are essential.
For USB 3.x SuperSpeed functionality, you also need the SSTX and SSRX pairs.
For USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) and advanced features, the CC pins carry additional negotiation signals, and VBUS can be higher than 5 V (e.g., 9 V, 12 V, 20 V, etc.) once negotiation is complete.
Always consult the official USB Type-C Cable and Connector Specification for precise details on electrical requirements and mechanical dimensions.
