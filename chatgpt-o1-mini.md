Same as o1 - all the pins are correct except RX2 and RX1 have the polarity backwards - A11 & A10, and B11 & B10 need to be swapped. Three out of four points

>>> Provide the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector

Thought about USB Type-C pinout for a few seconds
A female USB Type-C connector contains a total of 24 pins, arranged symmetrically across two rows labeled A and B, with each row having 12 pins. This symmetry allows the connector to be reversible. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the pinout:

Row A:

A1: GND (Ground)
A2: TX1+ (SuperSpeed Transmit Pair 1 Positive)
A3: TX1− (SuperSpeed Transmit Pair 1 Negative)
A4: VCONN (Power for active cables/devices)
A5: CC1 (Configuration Channel 1, used for orientation detection, power negotiation, etc.)
A6: D+ (USB 2.0 data positive)
A7: D− (USB 2.0 data negative)
A8: SBU1 (Sideband Use 1, used for alternate modes like DisplayPort)
A9: VCONN (Second VCONN supply for cable power)
A10: RX2+ (SuperSpeed Receive Pair 2 Positive)
A11: RX2− (SuperSpeed Receive Pair 2 Negative)
A12: GND (Ground)
Row B:

B1: GND (Ground)
B2: TX2+ (SuperSpeed Transmit Pair 2 Positive)
B3: TX2− (SuperSpeed Transmit Pair 2 Negative)
B4: VCONN (Power for active cables/devices)
B5: CC2 (Configuration Channel 2)
B6: D+ (USB 2.0 data positive)
B7: D− (USB 2.0 data negative)
B8: SBU2 (Sideband Use 2)
B9: VCONN (Second VCONN supply for cable power)
B10: RX1+ (SuperSpeed Receive Pair 1 Positive)
B11: RX1− (SuperSpeed Receive Pair 1 Negative)
B12: GND (Ground)
Key Points:

The TX/RX pairs (A2/A3, A10/A11 on side A and B2/B3, B10/B11 on side B) are used for high-speed data transfer in SuperSpeed (USB 3.x) modes.
The CC pins (A5, B5) detect cable orientation and negotiate power roles and data roles.
VCONN pins (A4, A9, B4, B9) supply power to active cables or electronic markers if needed.
D+/D− pairs (A6/A7, B6/B7) handle USB 2.0 data.
SBU pins (A8, B8) are reserved for alternate mode functions like DisplayPort or Thunderbolt.
This comprehensive pin layout ensures versatility in connectivity, allowing for reversible plug insertion and supporting a range of data and power delivery functions.
