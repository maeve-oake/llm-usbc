### LLM interpretations of the USB-C specification

This idea came up as i was daydreaming about what i'd do to charge my laptop if i suddenly found myself stranded in the 1960s

Strange premise, but i realised i had a local LLM and ollama installed on my laptop! unfortunately it (llama3.2:3B) couldn't even get close to providing the pinout, let alone any other specs.

I've decided to concatonate responses from popular LLMs to see if *any* of them could provide something as simple as USB-C pinout

The question:

```
Provide the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector
```
