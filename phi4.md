>>> Please give me the pinout of a USB-C connector

The USB Type-C connector is a 24-pin reversible interface. Here's a basic overview of its pin configuration:

### Cable Side (A)

1. **VBUS (5V):** Power supply (+5V)
2. **GND:** Ground 
3. **CC1 (Configuration Channel 1)**
4. **SBU1 (Sideband Use 1)**
5. **D+ (Data Plus):** USB 2.0 data
6. **D- (Data Minus):** USB 2.0 data
7. **SBU2 (Sideband Use 2)**
8. **CC2 (Configuration Channel 2)**
9. **GND:** Ground 
10. **VSS (Shielding/Reference Ground):** Signal ground/shielding reference
11. **D+ (Data Plus):** USB 2.0 data
12. **D- (Data Minus):** USB 2.0 data
13. **SBU1 (Sideband Use 1)**
14. **CC1 (Configuration Channel 1)**
15. **GND:** Ground 
16. **VBUS (5V):** Power supply (+5V)
17-20. **TX/RX pairs for alternate modes (up to four lanes):** High-speed data transfer for USB 3.x and other protocols like DisplayPort, HDMI, etc.
21-24. **RX/TX pairs for alternate modes (up to four lanes):** High-speed data transfer

### Connector Side (B)

The pinout on the connector side matches that of the cable side but mirrored due to its reversible design.

### Key Functions:

- **CC Pins (Configuration Channel 1 and 2):** Used for orientation detection, role determination, and communication between devices.
  
- **SBU Pins (Sideband Use 1 and 2):** Can carry various protocol-specific data like audio or video in alternate modes.

- **VCONN Pin:** Provides power for cable electronics. Typically connected to CC via an E-marker chip.

The USB-C specification allows the connector to support a wide range of protocols beyond USB, including Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, HDMI, and more, due to its versatile pin configuration 
and capability for "alternate modes."
