The model mentions that the pins 10 to 24 mirror pins 1 to 9, however you can't mirror 9 pins into 14 remaining spaces. maybe it's ignored GND? if you shift all of the pins down one THEN mirror and set remaining pins as GND you'd be get a little closer to reality.

The model doesn't list any ground pins, but does think of them. It seems to think the pins are in two rows of eight rather than two rows of twelve.

DPP and DMN (supposedly stands for "Data Pair Negative") seem to be the TX and RX for USB3.1 SS and not USB2.0.

Give the models' inner thoughts a read, it's rather interesting!

Although the model did spent a very long time thinking, the only part of the spec it got right was the amount of pins at 24. 1 out of 4 points.

>>> Provide the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the pinout for a female USB Type-C connector. Hmm, I 
remember that USB Type-C is reversible, which means you can plug it in either way and it 
still works. But I'm not exactly sure about all the pins and their functions.

Let me start by recalling what I know. The USB Type-C connector has 24 pins, arranged in 
two rows of eight each. Each row has four pairs: two for power and four for data 
transmission (I think). So, that's probably where the VBUS comes from, which is the power 
line.

Wait, but how exactly are they arranged? I remember hearing something about specific pin 
numbers corresponding to functions. Maybe the outer rows have some common pins like 
ground or power, while the inner ones handle the data?

So, if I imagine looking at the connector from the top, the layout might be something 
like this: the first row has VBUS on one end and maybe GND on the other. Then, moving 
inward, there are four pairs for data, each consisting of a pair of wires for 
transmitting and receiving.

I think pin 1 is VBUS, which provides power to the device. Pin 2 might be DPP (Data Pair 
Positive), used for high-speed communication when in USB 3.0 or higher. Then pin 3 could 
be DMN (Data Negative) for that same purpose. Next would be SBU (Side Band Utility) pins, 
maybe pin 4 is SBU1 and pin 5 is SBU2. These might be for additional signaling.

After the data pins, I guess there are ground pins to complete the circuit. So pin 6 
could be GND, then pin 7 might be DPC (another data pair), pin 8 as DMC, and pin 9 as 
another GND. Moving to the inner rows, which are probably the same on both sides due to 
the reversible nature, so pin 10 is VBUS again, pin 11 is DPP, pin 12 is DMN, then pins 
13 and 14 could be SBU again? Or maybe they serve a different function.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look up the standard pin layout. From 
what I remember, the USB Type-C specification defines specific pins in each row. The 
first outer row has VBUS, DPP, DMN, SBU1, and GND. Then, the inner rows also have similar 
configurations but mirrored because of the connector's symmetry.

So, for a female connector, each pin would correspond to its male counterpart. Each pin 
number from 1 to 24 is assigned a specific function according to the USB Type-C standard. 
For example:

- Pin 1: VBUS (power)
- Pin 2: DPP
- Pin 3: DMN
- Pins 4 and 5: SBU1 and SBU2
- Pins 6, 7, 8, and 9: Grounds
- Then the inner rows have similar functions but are used for alternate modes or 
additional data pairs.

Wait, that might not be accurate. I think each of the four data lanes has its own pair of 
pins on both sides. So, there's a total of eight data-related pins in two sets of four, 
along with power and ground lines.

I'm also trying to remember if there are any specific pin assignments for different modes 
like USB 2.0 versus USB 3.0 or when using video output (DisplayPort Alt Mode). I think 
the SBU pins are involved in that, handling side-band communication for alternate modes.

So, putting it all together, the female USB Type-C connector would have:

- Pin 1: VBUS
- Pins 2 and 3: DPP and DMN for high-speed data
- Pins 4 and 5: SBU1 and SBU2 for side-band signals
- Pins 6, 7, 8, 9: Grounds to complete the circuit
- Then on the inner rows (pins 10 to 24), similar functions but mirrored or used for 
alternate modes.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact pin numbers and their assignments. Maybe it's 
better to refer to the USB Type-C specification document to get the precise details, as I 
might be mixing up some of the pin functions and numbers.

The female USB Type-C connector features a symmetrical layout with 24 pins arranged in 
two rows of eight each. Each row contains power, ground, data pairs, and side-band 
utility signals for both high-speed communication and alternate modes like DisplayPort. 
Here's an organized breakdown:

### Pin Layout Overview:
- **Pins 1 & 10:** VBUS (Power) - Provides power to connected devices.
- **Pins 2 & 9:** DPP (Data Pair Positive) - Used for data transmission in high-speed USB 
modes.
- **Pins 3 & 8:** DMN (Data Pair Negative) - Complements DPP for data transmission.
- **Pins 4 & 7:** SBU1 (Side Band Utility 1) - Handles side-band signaling, crucial for 
alternate modes.
- **Pins 5 & 6:** SBU2 (Side Band Utility 2) - Similar to SBU1 but serves as a secondary 
channel.

### Inner Rows (Mirrored Functions):
- Pins 10-24 mirror the functions of pins 1-9, ensuring connectivity regardless of 
orientation due to the reversible nature of USB Type-C.

This layout ensures compatibility with both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 standards, supports 
high-speed data transfer, and accommodates alternate modes like DisplayPort Alt Mode 
through the SBU pins.
