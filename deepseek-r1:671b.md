R1 671b definitely performed better than the lower-parameter model, and ALMOST got full marks! It got the polarity between the USB 3 Superspeed ports correct, but unfortunately got the actual RX / TX pairs mirrored instead of reversed (B10 & B11 should be RX, and B2 and B3 should be TX), unlike the ChatGPT models. 3 out of 4 points.

>>> Provide the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector

Okay, so I need to figure out the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector. Let me start by recalling what I know about USB connectors. USB Type-C is the newer, reversible connector that's become standard for many devices now. It's used for charging, data transfer, and even video output in some cases.

First, I remember that USB Type-C has 24 pins. The connector is symmetrical, which is why you can plug it in either way. That symmetry probably means the pins are mirrored on both sides. So, maybe each side (A and B) has 12 pins, and when you flip the connector, it uses the other side's pins. That makes sense for the reversible feature.

Now, each pin has a specific function. The standard USB 2.0 connections have D+ and D- for data. Since Type-C is backward compatible, those pins must be there. Then there are the power pins, VBUS and GND. But Type-C can handle more power, so maybe there are multiple VBUS and GND pins to support higher currents.

There's also the CC (Configuration Channel) pins, which are used for negotiating power delivery and determining the orientation of the connector. I think there are two CC pins, CC1 and CC2. Since the connector is reversible, only one of them is used at a time to figure out the orientation.

Then there's the SBU (Sideband Use) pins, which might be used for alternate modes like DisplayPort or Thunderbolt. These are probably the ones labeled SBU1 and SBU2.

For high-speed data transfer, USB 3.1 and above use differential pairs. So there should be TX and RX pairs. Since Type-C supports USB 3.1/3.2, there are multiple TX and RX channels. Maybe TX1+/TX1- and RX1+/RX1- on one side, and TX2+/TX2- and RX2+/RX2- on the other. But because of the reversibility, when the connector is flipped, it switches which TX and RX pairs are used.

There's also the VCONN pin, which is used to power the electronics in a cable that has an e-marked chip. So one of the CC pins might become VCONN when needed.

Now, putting this all together, the pinout should list each pin number, its name, and function. Since it's a female connector, the pin numbering might be from the perspective of looking into the port. But I need to confirm how the pins are arranged physically.

Looking at the physical connector, the USB Type-C has two rows of 12 pins each. The top row (A) and bottom row (B) each have 12 pins. The numbering might start from the top left as A1, going to A12, and the bottom row as B1 to B12. But because the connector is reversible, some pins are mirrored. For example, the CC1 and CC2 would be on opposite sides depending on the plug orientation.

Wait, actually, when the plug is inserted either way, the host and device roles might switch some pins. But for the female connector, the pinout is fixed. So the pinout needs to reflect that each side (A and B) has certain pins, but when the cable is flipped, the device uses the corresponding pins on the other side.

Let me try to list the pins systematically. Starting with the top row (A1 to A12) and bottom row (B1 to B12):

A1: GND

A2: TX1+

A3: TX1-

A4: VBUS

A5: CC1

A6: D+

A7: D-

A8: SBU1

A9: VBUS

A10: RX2-

A11: RX2+

A12: GND

Then B1 to B12 would mirror some of these, but with CC2, SBU2, and the other TX/RX pairs. But I need to check if the numbering is consistent. Alternatively, perhaps the bottom row is a mirror of the top, so that when the plug is reversed, the B side pins connect to the A side in reverse order.

Wait, maybe the pinout is designed so that A and B sides are symmetrical. For example, A1 and B12 are both GND, A2 and B11 are TX1+/RX2+ or something like that. Let me think.

Actually, looking up a standard USB Type-C pinout (but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on memory), the typical arrangement is that the top and bottom rows are symmetrical. Each row has two sets of pins, so when the plug is flipped, the same functions are connected but through the opposite pins.

So, for example:

A1: GND

A2: SSTX1+ (SuperSpeed Transmit)

A3: SSTX1-

A4: VBUS

A5: CC1

A6: D+

A7: D-

A8: SBU1

A9: VBUS

A10: SSRX2- (SuperSpeed Receive)

A11: SSRX2+

A12: GND

Then the B row (B1 to B12) would be:

B1: GND

B2: SSRX1+

B3: SSRX1-

B4: VBUS

B5: CC2

B6: D+

B7: D-

B8: SBU2

B9: VBUS

B10: SSTX2-

B11: SSTX2+

B12: GND

Wait, but that might not be exactly right. The TX and RX pairs might be arranged so that when the plug is reversed, the TX on one side connects to RX on the other. So maybe on the A side, you have TX1 and RX2, and on the B side, TX2 and RX1. That way, regardless of the plug orientation, the correct pairs are connected.

Also, the D+ and D- lines are present on both sides but connected together internally, since USB 2.0 doesn't need separate pairs for each orientation.

The CC pins are CC1 on A5 and CC2 on B5. When the cable is inserted, only one CC pin is used to determine orientation, and the other becomes VCONN if needed.

The SBU pins are SBU1 on A8 and SBU2 on B8, used for alternate modes.

VBUS is on A4, A9, B4, B9, providing power. GND is on A1, A12, B1, B12.

So compiling all this, the female USB Type-C connector pinout would have two rows, A and B, each with 12 pins. The functions would be as follows for each pin:

Row A (top):

A1: GND

A2: TX1+

A3: TX1-

A4: VBUS

A5: CC1

A6: D+

A7: D-

A8: SBU1

A9: VBUS

A10: RX2-

A11: RX2+

A12: GND

Row B (bottom):

B1: GND

B2: RX1+

B3: RX1-

B4: VBUS

B5: CC2

B6: D+

B7: D-

B8: SBU2

B9: VBUS

B10: TX2-

B11: TX2+

B12: GND

Wait, but the RX and TX pairs might be labeled differently. For example, when looking at the host and device, the TX from the host should connect to the RX of the device. So depending on the orientation, the TX pairs on one side connect to RX on the other. Therefore, in the female connector (which is on the device, say a phone), the RX pairs would be connected to the TX from the host. But maybe in the pinout, the labels are from the host's perspective. Hmm, this might be a point of confusion.

Alternatively, the labels could be fixed based on the connector's perspective. So for the female connector, the TX and RX are from the connector's point of view. But I think the standard defines the pinout in a way that allows proper communication regardless of orientation.

Another thing to note is that the VBUS and GND pins are duplicated for higher current capacity. So multiple VBUS and GND pins allow for more power delivery without overheating.

Also, the D+ and D- are the USB 2.0 data lines, which are present on both A and B sides but are connected together, so that whichever orientation is used, the D+ and D- lines are properly connected.

The CC1 and CC2 pins are used for orientation detection and Power Delivery communication. The cable has a pull-up or pull-down resistor on one of the CC lines, allowing the device to determine which way the cable is inserted. The VCONN pin is used when the cable itself has an e-marked chip, requiring power, which would be provided through the CC pin that's not being used for communication.

The SBU1 and SBU2 are used for alternate modes like DisplayPort Alt Mode, where they can carry additional signals for video or other purposes.

Putting all this together, the pinout should list each pin with its designated function, keeping in mind the symmetry and the roles of each pin in power, data, and configuration.

The USB Type-C female connector has a symmetrical 24-pin design (12 pins per row, A and B), allowing reversible plug orientation. Here's the pinout:

Row A (Top)
Pin	Name	Function
A1	GND	Ground
A2	TX1+	SuperSpeed Transmit (Positive)
A3	TX1-	SuperSpeed Transmit (Negative)
A4	VBUS	Power (5V default)

A6	D+	USB 2.0 Data+
A7	D-	USB 2.0 Data-
A8	SBU1	Sideband Use 1 (Alt Modes e.g., DP)
A9	VBUS	Power (5V default)
A10	RX2-	SuperSpeed Receive (Negative)
A11	RX2+	SuperSpeed Receive (Positive)
A12	GND	Ground
Row B (Bottom)
Pin	Name	Function
B1	GND	Ground
B2	RX1+	SuperSpeed Receive (Positive)
B3	RX1-	SuperSpeed Receive (Negative)
B4	VBUS	Power (5V default)

B12	GND	Ground
Key Notes:
Reversibility: Pins are mirrored (e.g., TX1±/RX2± on Row A correspond to RX1±/TX2± on Row B).

Power Delivery: Multiple VBUS/GND pins support up to 100W (20V@5A) via USB PD.

Configuration Channels (CC1/CC2): Detect orientation, manage PD, and provide VCONN (for active cables).

USB 2.0: D+/D- are shared across both rows for backward compatibility.

Alt Modes: SBU1/SBU2 enable protocols like DisplayPort or Thunderbolt.

This design ensures universal compatibility and flexibility across charging, data, and video applications.
