Mistral thinks the USB-C connector is a circle, which is quite funny.

>>> Provide the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector

 A standard USB Type-C connector, regardless of being male or female, has the same layout on both sides. However, for clarity, I'll describe the female USB Type-C connector pinout:

1. CC1 (5V): Positive power (default voltage is 5V, but can also support up to 20V)
2. CC2 (+2.5V): VBUS detection and input current sensing (maximum current is 5A)
3. D- (Data -)
4. SBU1: Sleeve for USB3.x alternate modes like DisplayPort, HDMI, MHL, etc.
5. GND (Ground)
6. SBU2: Alternate mode signal or power sharing for USB Power Delivery
7. D+ (Data +)
8. VBUS (Power +): Provides up to 100W of power through USB Power Delivery
9. TxD+ (Transmit Data +): Transmitted data signal for USB Type-C
10. RXD+ (Receive Data +): Received data signal for USB Type-C

These pins are arranged circularly in the connector, with the mechanical symmetry allowing for easy insertion and reversible connections. The USB-IF (USB Implementers Forum) provides 
detailed specifications on this layout and associated signaling standards
