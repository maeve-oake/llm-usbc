o3-mini managed to get nothing notable except the USB-2 pins (and polarity) correct! the messup with GND is a real shame. 2 out of 4 points.

>>> Provide the pinout of a female USB Type-C connector

Thought about USB Type-C pinout for 11 seconds
The female USB Type‑C connector is a 24‑pin device arranged in two rows (the A‑side and the B‑side), each containing 12 pins. Below is a typical pinout configuration as defined by the USB Type‑C specification:

A‑Side (when looking at the receptacle with the plug inserted):

A1: GND
A2: SSTXp1 (SuperSpeed transmit, positive)
A3: SSTXn1 (SuperSpeed transmit, negative)
A4: VBUS
A5: CC1 (Configuration Channel)
A6: Dp1 (USB 2.0 differential pair, positive)
A7: Dn1 (USB 2.0 differential pair, negative)
A8: SBU1 (Sideband use)
A9: VCONN (Power for active cables/devices)
A10: VCONN (Alternate)
A11: CC1 (Configuration Channel – duplicate for symmetry)
A12: VBUS
B‑Side:

B1: VBUS
B2: SSTXp2 (SuperSpeed transmit, positive)
B3: SSTXn2 (SuperSpeed transmit, negative)
B4: VBUS
B5: CC2 (Configuration Channel)
B6: Dp2 (USB 2.0 differential pair, positive)
B7: Dn2 (USB 2.0 differential pair, negative)
B8: SBU2 (Sideband use)
B9: VCONN (Power for active cables/devices)
B10: VCONN (Alternate)
B11: CC2 (Configuration Channel – duplicate for symmetry)
B12: VBUS
Notes:

VBUS provides the main power (nominally 5V, though higher voltages may be negotiated under USB Power Delivery).
GND is the ground reference.
The SuperSpeed (SSTX/SSTXn) and USB 2.0 (Dp/Dn) pairs are used for data transmission.
The CC pins are essential for plug orientation detection, role negotiation, and cable detection.
The SBU pins are used for alternate modes (like audio or video transmissions) or other sideband communications.
VCONN is supplied only when needed (e.g., powering active cables) and is routed on specific CC or dedicated pins.
Keep in mind that while this is the standard configuration, always refer to the specific USB Type‑C specification or the manufacturer’s datasheet for details related to your particular application or device revision.
